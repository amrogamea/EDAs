# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) I conducted as part of my data science projects. The analyses are focused on uncovering insights, patterns, and relationships in the data using various statistical and visualization techniques.

EDA Objectives

The main goals of the EDA were:

To identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
To understand the distribution of key features.
To explore relationships and correlations between variables.
To detect any potential outliers or anomalies in the data.
To provide a foundation for further modeling and analysis.
Datasets Used

A variety of datasets were used for this analysis, including:

- Employee Attrition Dataset
- Miami's Weather Dataset
- Spam Dataset
- German Cars Dataset

Key Analyses and Techniques

The following techniques were used to explore the datasets:

## Data Cleaning:
Handled missing or incomplete data.
Removed or imputed outliers.
Univariate Analysis:
Histograms, box plots, and bar charts were used to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) were calculated for each key feature.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:
Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps were created to examine relationships between variables.
Grouped analysis was performed to explore patterns based on categorical variables.
Feature Correlation:
Correlation matrices and pairplots were used to identify relationships between numerical features.
Visualizations


## Tools and Libraries Used

The following tools and Python libraries were used for the analysis:

Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
Scikit-learn for feature scaling and preprocessing.

## Conclusions

The EDA provided critical insights that will guide the next steps in the project, including feature selection, modeling, and further statistical analysis.
